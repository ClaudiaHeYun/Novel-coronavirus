# Data Deliverable

## Goal

Use flight route traffic to establish a measure of connectedness between cities interationally. With this connectedness measure and case numbers, predict the spread in case/10,000 of CoVID-19 globally. In certain regions where intranational data is available, we plan to predict spread between states/provinces/territories.

## Data Spec


## How to download

All the data for this project can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/ClaudiaHeYun/Novel-coronavirus) in `/data` which contains `population/`, `flights/`, and `virus`.
Population has data about places and their populations, flights has information about airports and routes between them, and
virus has case report data.

## Sample Data

A sample of your data (e.g. 10 - 100 rows) that we can easily open and view on our computers.

### Data Cleanliness

Are there any other considerations you took into account when collecting your data? This is open-ended based on your data; feel free to leave this blank. (Example: If it's user data, is it public/are they consenting to have their data used? Is the data potentially skewed in any direction?)

How clean is the data? Does this data contain what you need in order to complete the project you proposed to do? (Each team will have to go about answering this question differently, but use the following questions as a guide. Graphs and tables are highly encouraged if they allow you to answer these questions more succinctly.)

- How many data points are there total? How many are there in each group you care about (e.g. if you are dividing your data into positive/negative examples, are they split evenly)? Do you think this is enough data to do what you hope to do?
- Are there missing values? Do these occur in fields that are important for your project's goals?
-Are there duplicates? Do these occur in fields that are important for your project's goals?
- How is the data distributed? Is it uniform or skewed? Are there outliers? What are the min/max values? (focus on the fields that are most relevant to your project goals)
- Are there any data type issues (e.g. words in fields that were supposed to be numeric)? Where are these coming from? (E.g. a bug in your scraper? User input?) How will you fix them?
- Do you need to throw any data away? What data? Why? Any reason this might affect the analyses you are able to run or the conclusions you are able to draw?
